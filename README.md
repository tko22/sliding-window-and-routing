# Routing and Sliding Window Algorithm
This code is from MPs in CS438 (computer networking).

It implements two algorithms
- routing
- sliding window algorithm

## Routing
implements distance vector and link state routing. Maintains forwarding table and converges within 5 seconds whenever network is partitioned.

## Sliding Window
implements the sliding window protocol. window size adapts to RTT and bandwith - just like TCP.
